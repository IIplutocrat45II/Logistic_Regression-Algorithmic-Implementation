Implementation of gradient descent algorithm in a Logistic Regression model  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
tqdm
sklearn

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

If the required dependencies (prerequisites) are already installed, please skip this part.
To install these prerequisites, Open the respective command line interface (powershell, terminal) and paste the following:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tqdm
pip install matplotlib

```

## Running the tests

Ensure that dataset is on the same folder as the program and run the python program.

### Debugging
To ensure that the gradient descent is working proper, we plot a graph between number of iterations and the cost function,
